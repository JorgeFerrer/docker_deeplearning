    "Have you ever developed a program that is able to find an object in an image? This was science fiction not so long ago, but machine learning is evolving so fast that now any developer can do it. Here is what you will need:\n",
    "1. Training data: We will be using the public data from CIFAR10\n",
    "1. A powerful machine (ideally with GPUs). But if not, it's ok, it will just be quite a bit slower ;)\n",
    "1. A Neural Nets Library: We will be using Google's TensorFlow and it's high level abstraction called TFLearn\n",
    "1. The algorithms and network topology known to produce good results: As you learn more and more about machine learning you will slowly be able to do this on your own. For now, trust what is shown below and play with it, tweeking the parameters and observing if the resulting model is more or less accurate."
